# Linear Regression

- supervised learning mecahnism for predicting quantitative response

## Simple Linear Regression

- predict quantitative result *Y* using a single predictor *X*
- assumes a roughly linear relationship between *Y* and *X*

    - "we are regressing *Y* onto *X*"

        - estimation for a single instance
    - in this equation we're just trying to find the values of slope and intercept
